Header Inclusions:

#include <stdio.h>: Provides input/output functionalities like printf() and scanf().
#include <stdlib.h>: Includes functions like malloc() and free() for memory allocation and deallocation.
#include <sys/time.h>: Defines structures and functions for handling time-related operations.
#include <pthread.h>: Provides functionalities for multi-threading.
#include <string.h>: Provides string manipulation functions like strcmp().
#include <semaphore.h>: Defines semaphores for thread synchronization.
External Function Declaration:

extern float etime();: Declares an external function etime() which is expected to measure elapsed time. This function is likely defined elsewhere.
Global Variables:

sem_t semaphore: Semaphore used for synchronization.
int num_threads: Number of threads to be used for parallel execution.
int matrix_size: Size of the square matrices for multiplication (set to 400).
int result_matrix[400][400], matrix_A[400][400], matrix_B[400][400]: Arrays to store the result matrix and the two input matrices.
Thread Function:

void *matrixWorker(void *thread_ptr): This function is executed by each pthread. It computes a subset of rows of the result matrix multiplication.
It uses a semaphore to signal when each thread completes its computation.
Main Function:

Parses the command-line argument to determine the number of threads to be used.
Initializes the semaphore using sem_init().
Initializes the input matrices matrix_A and matrix_B with values of 1.
Measures the start time using etime().
Creates num_threads pthreads, each executing the matrixWorker function.
Waits for all threads to complete using sem_wait() on the semaphore.
Measures the elapsed time again using etime() after all threads complete their computation.
Prints the elapsed time.
In summary, this program performs matrix multiplication in parallel using pthreads. It divides the task among multiple threads, synchronizes them using a semaphore, and measures the time taken for the entire multiplication process to complete. Finally, it prints the elapsed time.
